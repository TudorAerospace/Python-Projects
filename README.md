I have created this repository so that I may upload here my hitherto created projects in Python, alongside those that I shall create in the future. 
I hope that you may find use in these projects, either to use in your own projects, or as reference for creating projects of your own.

This repository includes projects ranging from practice exercises, to games and apps. You will find each type in the appropriate folder.

Contributing
